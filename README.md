# MSBuild SDKs
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_apis/build/status/MSBuild/microsoft.MSBuildSdks%20Official?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/latest?definitionId=13584&branchName=main)

The MSBuild project SDKs are used to configure and extend your build.

## What SDKs are available?

### [Microsoft.Build.Traversal](src/Traversal)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Build.Traversal.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Traversal)
 [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Microsoft.Build.Traversal.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Traversal)

Supports creating traversal projects which are MSBuild projects that indicate what projects to include when building your tree.  For large project trees, they are replacements for Visual Studio solution files.

### [Microsoft.Build.NoTargets](src/NoTargets)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Build.NoTargets.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.NoTargets)
 [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Microsoft.Build.NoTargets.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.NoTargets)

Supports utility projects that do not compile an assembly.

### [Microsoft.Build.Artifacts](src/Artifacts)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Build.Artifacts.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Artifacts)
 [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Microsoft.Build.Artifacts.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.Artifacts)

Supports staging artifacts from build outputs.

### [Microsoft.Build.CopyOnWrite](src/CopyOnWrite)
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.Build.CopyOnWrite.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.CopyOnWrite)
 [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/Microsoft.Build.CopyOnWrite.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Build.CopyOnWrite)

Enables Copy on Write for faster file copies.

## How can I use these SDKs?

When using an MSBuild Project SDK obtained via NuGet (such as the SDKs in this repo) a specific version **must** be specified.

Either append the version to the package name:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.Build.Traversal/2.0.12">
  ...
```

Or omit the version from the SDK attribute and specify it in the version in `global.json`, which can be useful to synchronise versions across multiple projects in a solution:

```json
{
  "msbuild-sdks": {
    "Microsoft.Build.Traversal" : "2.0.12"
  }
}
```

Since MSBuild 15.6, SDKs are downloaded as NuGet packages automatically. Earlier versions of MSBuild 15 required SDKs to be installed. 

For more information, [read the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/how-to-use-project-sdk).

## What are MSBuild SDKS?
MSBuild 15.0 introduced new project XML for .NET Core that we refer to as SDK-style.  These SDK-style projects looks like:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

At evaluation time, MSBuild adds implicit imports at the top and bottom of the project like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <Import Project="Sdk.props" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <Import Project="Sdk.targets" Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk" />
</Project>
```
